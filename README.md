Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning
 
 Project Summary:
“Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning” aims, as the name suggests, to predict the lifespan on a human being, based on diverse datasets, in a demographic region. The life of a human depends on various factors such as Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors. The project aims to predict an average life expectancy based on these and several other factors. This project finds the expected solution using various machine learning algorithms 

Technical Requirements:
1. The dataset must be in csv format.
2. Machine Learning Algorithms must be applied with the help of Python. 
3. IBM cloud account.
4. IBM Watson and Node-Red flow.
